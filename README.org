* OrgMarker
  A super fast org-mode syntax marker written in swift.

* swift-org vs. OrgMarker
  This is a rewrite from ground up based on my other org-mode parser [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/swift-org][swift-org]].
  swift-org is more of a traditional syntax parser, which understands the syntax
  in your org files and provide you with useful data extracted from them. e.g.
  =TODO= items. In the contrary, =OrgMarker= is more *markup* oriented. Compared
  to swift-org, it is a better approach for syntax highlighting. At the same
  time, it can also be used as a traditional parser like swift-org. Also it is
  aiming for better performance.

* Basic Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC swift
    import OrgMarker
    let text = "* hello world\n"
    let marker = OrgMarker()
    let marks = marker.mark(text)
  #+END_SRC

* Release

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
    agvtool new-marketing-version 0.1.1
    # sed -i.bak "s/s\.version = .*/s\.version = '0\.7\.9'/" SwiftOrg.podspec
  #+END_SRC
